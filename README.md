# IOCM8
IOCM8 scans a windows system for known IOC (indicators of compromise) outlined within the script.
IOCM8 defines a list of known IOCs and then iterates through each IOC to check if it is present on the system. If the IOC is present, the script prints information about the IOC, such as its properties, network connections, or DNS queries.
